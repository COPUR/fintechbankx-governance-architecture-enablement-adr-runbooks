# ADR-006: Zero-Trust Security Architecture

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - Implemented December 2024

## Context

From my experience architecting security solutions for major financial institutions including implementations at global investment banks and regional banking consortiums, Zero Trust architecture has become the de facto standard for enterprise banking security. Having witnessed the evolution from perimeter-based security to identity-centric models across multiple production environments, this ADR codifies proven Zero Trust patterns specifically tailored for banking system architectures.

The Enhanced Enterprise Banking System requires a comprehensive security architecture that assumes no implicit trust within the network perimeter. Modern banking systems face sophisticated threats that require defense-in-depth strategies with continuous verification of every transaction, user, and device.

### Current Security Challenges
- **Legacy Perimeter Security**: Traditional castle-and-moat security models are insufficient
- **Insider Threats**: Need protection against malicious or compromised internal actors
- **Lateral Movement**: Prevention of threat propagation within the network
- **Compliance Requirements**: Strict regulatory requirements for financial services
- **Cloud-Native Challenges**: Dynamic, distributed environments require new security approaches
- **API Security**: Extensive API surface area requires comprehensive protection

### Regulatory and Compliance Requirements
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **SOX**: Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance for financial reporting
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation for data privacy
- **FAPI**: Financial-grade API security requirements
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management guidelines
- **FFIEC Guidelines**: Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council guidance

### Business Requirements
- Protect customer financial data and personal information
- Ensure business continuity and system availability
- Maintain regulatory compliance and pass audits
- Support digital transformation initiatives securely
- Enable secure remote work and third-party integrations
- Provide comprehensive audit trails for investigations

## Decision

We have decided to implement a **Zero-Trust Security Architecture** across the Enhanced Enterprise Banking System, incorporating multiple layers of security controls and continuous verification principles.

### Core Zero-Trust Principles

#### 1. Never Trust, Always Verify
- Every user, device, and network flow must be authenticated and authorized
- Continuous verification throughout the session lifecycle
- No implicit trust based on network location or previous authentication

#### 2. Least Privilege Access
- Minimum necessary permissions for users and services
- Just-in-time access provisioning
- Regular access reviews and recertification

#### 3. Assume Breach
- Design systems assuming attackers have already gained access
- Implement detection and response capabilities
- Limit blast radius through segmentation

#### 4. Verify Explicitly
- Use multiple sources of data for access decisions
- Combine identity, device, location, and behavioral signals
- Real-time risk assessment for access decisions
