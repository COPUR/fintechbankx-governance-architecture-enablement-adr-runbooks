# ADR-004: OAuth 2.1 with Keycloak for Authentication and Authorization

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - Implemented December 2024

## Context

Based on extensive experience implementing authentication systems for Tier 1 financial institutions across North America and EMEA, this ADR addresses the critical security infrastructure requirements for enterprise banking systems. Drawing from lessons learned in production banking environments processing millions of daily transactions, the authentication architecture must satisfy stringent regulatory requirements while maintaining operational excellence.

The Enhanced Enterprise Banking System requires a robust, secure, and compliant authentication and authorization solution that meets financial industry standards. The system must support:

- **Financial-grade API (FAPI) 1.0 Advanced** compliance for financial services
- **OAuth 2.1** security best practices with PKCE
- **Multi-factor authentication** for enhanced security
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** for banking operations
- **Integration with enterprise identity providers** (LDAP/Active Directory)
- **Comprehensive audit trails** for regulatory compliance
- **Zero-trust security** principles
- **Scalable identity management** for microservices architecture

### Current Challenges
- Legacy authentication systems lack modern security features
- Compliance requirements for PCI DSS, SOX, and GDPR
- Need for centralized identity management across microservices
- Integration with existing enterprise directory services
- Support for multiple client types (web, mobile, API)

### Requirements
- FAPI 1.0 Advanced security profile compliance
- OAuth 2.1 with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Banking-specific role and permission management
- Enterprise directory integration (LDAP/AD)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- High availability and scalability
- Support for refresh token rotation
- Financial-grade cryptographic requirements

## Decision

We have decided to implement **OAuth 2.1 with Keycloak** as our primary authentication and authorization solution.

### Selected Solution: Keycloak OAuth 2.1 Implementation

**Keycloak** is chosen as the identity and access management solution with the following configuration:

#### Core Components
1. **Keycloak OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server**
   - Banking-specific realm configuration
   - FAPI 1.0 Advanced compliance
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Multi-factor authentication

2. **OAuth2 Proxy Integration**
   - Authorization Code Flow with PKCE
   - Session management
   - Token refresh handling
   - Request/response filtering

3. **Istio Service Mesh Integration**
   - JWT token validation at sidecar level
   - RequestAuthentication policies
   - AuthorizationPolicy for fine-grained access control

#### Banking Realm Configuration
```json
{
  "realm": "banking-system",
  "displayName": "Enhanced Enterprise Banking System",
  "enabled": true,
  "sslRequired": "external",
  "accessTokenLifespan": 300,
  "refreshTokenMaxReuse": 0,
  "defaultSignatureAlgorithm": "RS256",
  "clients": [
    {
      "clientId": "banking-system-frontend",
      "name": "Banking System Frontend",
      "protocol": "openid-connect",
      "standardFlowEnabled": true,
      "attributes": {
        "pkce.code.challenge.method": "S256"
      }
    }
  ],
  "roles": {
    "realm": [
      {"name": "banking-admin", "description": "Banking system administrator"},
      {"name": "banking-manager", "description": "Banking manager"},
      {"name": "banking-officer", "description": "Banking officer"},
      {"name": "banking-customer", "description": "Banking customer"}
    ]
  }
}
```

    participant Keycloak as Keycloak OAuth 2.1 Server
    participant Service as Banking Microservice
    
    Client->>Gateway: 1. Access Protected Resource
    Gateway->>Client: 2. Redirect to Authorization (with PKCE challenge)
    Client->>Keycloak: 3. Authorization Request (code_challenge)
    Keycloak->>Client: 4. User Authentication + MFA
    Client->>Keycloak: 5. User Consent
    Keycloak->>Client: 6. Authorization Code
    Client->>Gateway: 7. Authorization Code + code_verifier
    Gateway->>Keycloak: 8. Token Exchange (validate PKCE)
    Keycloak->>Gateway: 9. JWT Access Token + Refresh Token
    Gateway->>Service: 10. API Request with JWT (validated by Envoy)
    Service->>Gateway: 11. API Response
    Gateway->>Client: 12. Final Response
```
